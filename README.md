# PINN_Base

A framework for building custom Physics Informed Neural Networks [PINNs](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs).

This was built in the course of my own research on PINNs as an alternative to copying and pasting code for each new idea I had. As a result, the base template is built for extending PINNs rather than as a interface for solving particular differential equations.

Currently, it supports Tensorflow 1.15. It was my original intention to have maintain feature parity for a Tensorflow 2.0 version as well however it is very far behind the 1.0 version and may be discontinued in the future.

## Installation

To install as a python module

```shell
pip install PINN_Base
```

Requirements include Tensorflow 1.15, as well as the usual suspects from the scipy stack.

## Usage

See examples.
